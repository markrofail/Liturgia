text:
  english: "That was the true Light which gives light to every man coming into the
    world. He was in the world, and the world was made through Him, and the
    world did not know Him. He came to His own, and His own did not receive Him.
    But as many as received Him, to them He gave the right to become children of
    God, to those who believe in His name: who were born, not of blood, nor of
    the will of the flesh, nor of the will of man, but of God. And the Word
    became flesh and dwelt among us, and we beheld His glory, the glory as of
    the only begotten of the Father, full of grace and truth."
  arabic: كَانَ النُّورُ الْحَقِيقِيُّ الَّذِي يُنِيرُ كُلَّ إِنْسَانٍ آتِياً
    إِلَى الْعَالَمِ. كَانَ فِي الْعَالَمِ وَكُوِّنَ الْعَالَمُ بِهِ وَلَمْ
    يَعْرِفْهُ الْعَالَمُ. إِلَى خَاصَّتِهِ جَاءَ وَخَاصَّتُهُ لَمْ تَقْبَلْهُ.
    وَأَمَّا كُلُّ الَّذِينَ قَبِلُوهُ فَأَعْطَاهُمْ سُلْطَاناً أَنْ يَصِيرُوا
    أَوْلاَدَ اللَّهِ أَيِ الْمُؤْمِنُونَ بِاسْمِهِ. اَلَّذِينَ وُلِدُوا لَيْسَ
    مِنْ دَمٍ وَلاَ مِنْ مَشِيئَةِ جَسَدٍ وَلاَ مِنْ مَشِيئَةِ رَجُلٍ بَلْ مِنَ
    اللَّهِ. وَالْكَلِمَةُ صَارَ جَسَداً وَحَلَّ بَيْنَنَا وَرَأَيْنَا مَجْدَهُ
    مَجْداً كَمَا لِوَحِيدٍ مِنَ الآبِ مَمْلُوءاً نِعْمَةً وَحَقّاً.
