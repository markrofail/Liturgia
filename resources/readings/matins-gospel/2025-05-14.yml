  english: Then His brothers and His mother came, and standing outside they sent
    to Him, calling Him. And a multitude was sitting around Him; and they said
    to Him, "Look, Your mother and Your brothers are outside seeking You." But
    He answered them, saying, "Who is My mother, or My brothers?" And He looked
    around in a circle at those who sat about Him, and said, "Here are My mother
    and My brothers! For whoever does the will of God is My brother and My
    sister and mother."
  arabic: "فَجَاءَتْ حِينَئِذٍ إِخْوَتُهُ وَأُمُّهُ وَوَقَفُوا خَارِجاً
    وَأَرْسَلُوا إِلَيْهِ يَدْعُونَهُ. وَكَانَ الْجَمْعُ جَالِساً حَوْلَهُ
    فَقَالُوا لَهُ: «هُوَذَا أُمُّكَ وَإِخْوَتُكَ خَارِجاً يَطْلُبُونَكَ».
    فَأَجَابَهُمْ: «مَنْ أُمِّي وَإِخْوَتِي؟» ثُمَّ نَظَرَ حَوْلَهُ إِلَى
    الْجَالِسِينَ وَقَالَ: «هَا أُمِّي وَإِخْوَتِي لأَنَّ مَنْ يَصْنَعُ
    مَشِيئَةَ اللَّهِ هُوَ أَخِي وَأُخْتِي وَأُمِّي»."
