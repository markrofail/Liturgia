  english: "Paul, an apostle not from men nor through man, but through Jesus
    Christ and God the Father who raised Him from the dead, and all the brethren
    who are with me, To the churches of Galatia: Grace to you and peace from God
    the Father and our Lord Jesus Christ, who gave Himself for our sins, that He
    might deliver us from this present evil age, according to the will of our
    God and Father, to whom be glory forever and ever. Amen. I marvel that you
    are turning away so soon from Him who called you in the grace of Christ, to
    a different gospel, which is not another; but there are some who trouble you
    and want to pervert the gospel of Christ. But even if we, or an angel from
    heaven, preach any other gospel to you than what we have preached to you,
    let him be accursed. As we have said before, so now I say again, if anyone
    preaches any other gospel to you than what you have received, let him be
    accursed. For do I now persuade men, or God? Or do I seek to please men? For
    if I still pleased men, I would not be a bondservant of Christ. But I make
    known to you, brethren, that the gospel which was preached by me is not
    according to man. For I neither received it from man, nor was I taught it,
    but it came through the revelation of Jesus Christ. For you have heard of my
    former conduct in Judaism, how I persecuted the church of God beyond measure
    and tried to destroy it. And I advanced in Judaism beyond many of my
    contemporaries in my own nation, being more exceedingly zealous for the
    traditions of my fathers. But when it pleased God, who separated me from my
    mother's womb and called me through His grace, to reveal His Son in me, that
    I might preach Him among the Gentiles, I did not immediately confer with
    flesh and blood, nor did I go up to Jerusalem to those who were apostles
    before me; but I went to Arabia, and returned again to Damascus. Then after
    three years I went up to Jerusalem to see Peter, and remained with him
    fifteen days. But I saw none of the other apostles except James, the Lord's
    brother. Now concerning the things which I write to you, indeed, before God,
    I do not lie. Afterward I went into the regions of Syria and Cilicia. And I
    was unknown by face to the churches of Judea which were in Christ. But they
    were hearing only, \"He who formerly persecuted us now preaches the faith
    which he once tried to destroy.\" And they glorified God in me. Jude, a
    bondservant of Jesus Christ, and brother of James, To those who are called,
    sanctified by God the Father, and preserved in Jesus Christ: Mercy, peace,
    and love be multiplied to you. Beloved, while I was very diligent to write
    to you concerning our common salvation, I found it necessary to write to you
    exhorting you to contend earnestly for the faith which was once for all
    delivered to the saints. For certain men have crept in unnoticed, who long
    ago were marked out for this condemnation, ungodly men, who turn the grace
    of our God into lewdness and deny the only Lord God and our Lord Jesus
    Christ. But I want to remind you, though you once knew this, that the Lord,
    having saved the people out of the land of Egypt, afterward destroyed those
    who did not believe. And the angels who did not keep their proper domain,
    but left their own abode, He has reserved in everlasting chains under
    darkness for the judgment of the great day; as Sodom and Gomorrah, and the
    cities around them in a similar manner to these, having given themselves
    over to sexual immorality and gone after strange flesh, are set forth as an
    example, suffering the vengeance of eternal fire. Likewise also these
    dreamers defile the flesh, reject authority, and speak evil of dignitaries.
    Yet Michael the archangel, in contending with the devil, when he disputed
    about the body of Moses, dared not bring against him a reviling accusation,
    but said, \"The Lord rebuke you!\" But these speak evil of whatever they do
    not know; and whatever they know naturally, like brute beasts, in these
    things they corrupt themselves. Woe to them! For they have gone in the way
    of Cain, have run greedily in the error of Balaam for profit, and perished
    in the rebellion of Korah. These are spots in your love feasts, while they
    feast with you without fear, serving only themselves. They are clouds
    without water, carried about by the winds; late autumn trees without fruit,
    twice dead, pulled up by the roots; raging waves of the sea, foaming up
    their own shame; wandering stars for whom is reserved the blackness of
    darkness forever. Now Enoch, the seventh from Adam, prophesied about these
    men also, saying, \"Behold, the Lord comes with ten thousands of His saints,
    to execute judgment on all, to convict all who are ungodly among them of all
    their ungodly deeds which they have committed in an ungodly way, and of all
    the harsh things which ungodly sinners have spoken against Him.\" These are
    grumblers, complainers, walking according to their own lusts; and they mouth
    great swelling words, flattering people to gain advantage. But you, beloved,
    remember the words which were spoken before by the apostles of our Lord
    Jesus Christ: how they told you that there would be mockers in the last time
    who would walk according to their own ungodly lusts. These are sensual
    persons, who cause divisions, not having the Spirit. But you, beloved,
    building yourselves up on your most holy faith, praying in the Holy Spirit,
    keep yourselves in the love of God, looking for the mercy of our Lord Jesus
    Christ unto eternal life. And on some have compassion, making a distinction;
    but others save with fear, pulling them out of the fire, hating even the
    garment defiled by the flesh. Now to Him who is able to keep you from
    stumbling, And to present you faultless Before the presence of His glory
    with exceeding joy, To God our Savior, Who alone is wise, Be glory and
    majesty, Dominion and power, Both now and forever. Amen. But at night an
    angel of the Lord opened the prison doors and brought them out, and said,
    \"Go, stand in the temple and speak to the people all the words of this
    life.\" And when they heard that, they entered the temple early in the
    morning and taught. But the high priest and those with him came and called
    the council together, with all the elders of the children of Israel, and
    sent to the prison to have them brought. But when the officers came and did
    not find them in the prison, they returned and reported, saying, \"Indeed we
    found the prison shut securely, and the guards standing outside before the
    doors; but when we opened them, we found no one inside!\" Oh, give thanks to
    the LORD, for He is good! For His mercy endures forever. Let Israel now say,
    \"His mercy endures forever.\" At that time the disciples came to Jesus,
    saying, \"Who then is greatest in the kingdom of heaven?\" Then Jesus called
    a little child to Him, set him in the midst of them, and said, \"Assuredly,
    I say to you, unless you are converted and become as little children, you
    will by no means enter the kingdom of heaven. Therefore whoever humbles
    himself as this little child is the greatest in the kingdom of heaven.
    Whoever receives one little child like this in My name receives Me.
    \"Whoever causes one of these little ones who believe in Me to sin, it would
    be better for him if a millstone were hung around his neck, and he were
    drowned in the depth of the sea. Woe to the world because of offenses! For
    offenses must come, but woe to that man by whom the offense comes! \"If your
    hand or foot causes you to sin, cut it off and cast it from you. It is
    better for you to enter into life lame or maimed, rather than having two
    hands or two feet, to be cast into the everlasting fire. And if your eye
    causes you to sin, pluck it out and cast it from you. It is better for you
    to enter into life with one eye, rather than having two eyes, to be cast
    into hell fire."

    بَذَلَ نَفْسَهُ لأَجْلِ خَطَايَانَا، لِيُنْقِذَنَا مِنَ الْعَالَمِ
    الْحَاضِرِ الشِّرِّيرِ حَسَبَ إِرَادَةِ اللهِ وَأَبِينَا، الَّذِي لَهُ

    تَنْتَقِلُونَ هَكَذَا سَرِيعاً عَنِ الَّذِي دَعَاكُمْ بِنِعْمَةِ الْمَسِيحِ
    إِلَى إِنْجِيلٍ آخَرَ. لَيْسَ هُوَ آخَرَ، غَيْرَ أَنَّهُ يُوجَدُ قَوْمٌ
    يُزْعِجُونَكُمْ وَيُرِيدُونَ أَنْ يُحَوِّلُوا إِنْجِيلَ الْمَسِيحِ. وَلَكِنْ
    إِنْ بَشَّرْنَاكُمْ نَحْنُ أَوْ مَلاَكٌ مِنَ السَّمَاءِ بِغَيْرِ مَا
    بَشَّرْنَاكُمْ، فَلْيَكُنْ «أَنَاثِيمَا». كَمَا سَبَقْنَا فَقُلْنَا أَقُولُ
    الآنَ أَيْضاً: إِنْ كَانَ أَحَدٌ يُبَشِّرُكُمْ بِغَيْرِ مَا قَبِلْتُمْ،
    فَلْيَكُنْ «أَنَاثِيمَا». أَفَأَسْتَعْطِفُ الآنَ النَّاسَ أَمِ اللهَ؟ أَمْ
    أَطْلُبُ أَنْ أُرْضِيَ النَّاسَ؟ فَلَوْ كُنْتُ بَعْدُ أُرْضِي النَّاسَ لَمْ
    أَكُنْ عَبْداً لِلْمَسِيحِ. وَأُعَرِّفُكُمْ أَيُّهَا الإِخْوَةُ الإِنْجِيلَ
    الَّذِي بَشَّرْتُ بِهِ، أَنَّهُ لَيْسَ بِحَسَبِ إِنْسَانٍ. لأَنِّي لَمْ
    أَقْبَلْهُ مِنْ عِنْدِ إِنْسَانٍ وَلاَ عُلِّمْتُهُ. بَلْ بِإِعْلاَنِ يَسُوعَ
    الْمَسِيحِ. فَإِنَّكُمْ سَمِعْتُمْ بِسِيرَتِي قَبْلاً فِي الدِّيَانَةِ
    الْيَهُودِيَّةِ، أَنِّي كُنْتُ أَضْطَهِدُ كَنِيسَةَ اللهِ بِإِفْرَاطٍ
    وَأُتْلِفُهَا. وَكُنْتُ أَتَقَدَّمُ فِي الدِّيَانَةِ الْيَهُودِيَّةِ عَلَى
    كَثِيرِينَ مِنْ أَتْرَابِي فِي جِنْسِي، إِذْ كُنْتُ أَوْفَرَ غَيْرَةً فِي
    تَقْلِيدَاتِ آبَائِي. وَلَكِنْ لَمَّا سَرَّ اللهَ الَّذِي أَفْرَزَنِي مِنْ
    بَطْنِ أُمِّي، وَدَعَانِي بِنِعْمَتِهِ أَنْ يُعْلِنَ ابْنَهُ فِيَّ
    لِأُبَشِّرَ بِهِ بَيْنَ الأُمَمِ، لِلْوَقْتِ لَمْ أَسْتَشِرْ لَحْماً وَدَماً
    وَلاَ صَعِدْتُ إِلَى أُورُشَلِيمَ إِلَى الرُّسُلِ الَّذِينَ قَبْلِي، بَلِ
    انْطَلَقْتُ إِلَى الْعَرَبِيَّةِ، ثُمَّ رَجَعْتُ أَيْضاً إِلَى دِمَشْقَ.
    ثُمَّ بَعْدَ ثَلاَثِ سِنِينَ صَعِدْتُ إِلَى أُورُشَلِيمَ لأَتَعَرَّفَ
    بِبُطْرُسَ، فَمَكَثْتُ عِنْدَهُ خَمْسَةَ عَشَرَ يَوْماً. وَلَكِنَّنِي لَمْ
    أَرَ غَيْرَهُ مِنَ الرُّسُلِ إِلاَّ يَعْقُوبَ أَخَا الرَّبِّ. وَالَّذِي
    أَكْتُبُ بِهِ إِلَيْكُمْ هُوَذَا قُدَّامَ اللهِ أَنِّي لَسْتُ أَكْذِبُ
    فِيهِ. وَبَعْدَ ذَلِكَ جِئْتُ إِلَى أَقَالِيمِ سُورِيَّةَ وَكِيلِيكِيَّةَ.
    وَلَكِنَّنِي كُنْتُ غَيْرَ مَعْرُوفٍ بِالْوَجْهِ عِنْدَ كَنَائِسِ
    الْيَهُودِيَّةِ الَّتِي فِي الْمَسِيحِ. غَيْرَ أَنَّهُمْ كَانُوا يَسْمَعُونَ
    أَنَّ الَّذِي كَانَ يَضْطَهِدُنَا قَبْلاً، يُبَشِّرُ الآنَ بِالإِيمَانِ
    الَّذِي كَانَ قَبْلاً يُتْلِفُهُ. فَكَانُوا يُمَجِّدُونَ اللهَ فِيَّ.
    وَلَكِنَّ مَلاَكَ الرَّبِّ فِي اللَّيْلِ فَتَحَ أَبْوَابَ السِّجْنِ
    وَأَخْرَجَهُمْ وَقَالَ: «اذْهَبُوا قِفُوا وَكَلِّمُوا الشَّعْبَ فِي
    الْهَيْكَلِ بِجَمِيعِ كَلاَمِ هَذِهِ الْحَيَاةِ». فَلَمَّا سَمِعُوا دَخَلُوا
    الْهَيْكَلَ نَحْوَ الصُّبْحِ وَجَعَلُوا يُعَلِّمُونَ. ثُمَّ جَاءَ رَئِيسُ
    الْكَهَنَةِ وَالَّذِينَ مَعَهُ وَدَعَوُا الْمَجْمَعَ وَكُلَّ مَشْيَخَةِ
    بَنِي إِسْرَائِيلَ فَأَرْسَلُوا إِلَى الْحَبْسِ لِيُؤْتَى بِهِمْ. وَلَكِنَّ
    الْخُدَّامَ لَمَّا جَاءُوا لَمْ يَجِدُوهُمْ فِي السِّجْنِ فَرَجَعُوا
    وَأَخْبَرُوا قَائِلِينَ: «إِنَّنَا وَجَدْنَا الْحَبْسَ مُغْلَقاً بِكُلِّ
    حِرْصٍ وَالْحُرَّاسَ وَاقِفِينَ خَارِجاً أَمَامَ الأَبْوَابِ وَلَكِنْ لَمَّا
    فَتَحْنَا لَمْ نَجِدْ فِي الدَّاخِلِ أَحَداً». اِحْمَدُوا الرَّبَّ لأَنَّهُ
    صَالِحٌ لأَنَّ إِلَى الأَبَدِ رَحْمَتَهُ. لِيَقُلْ إِسْرَائِيلُ: [إِنَّ
    إِلَى الأَبَدِ رَحْمَتَهُ]. فِي تِلْكَ السَّاعَةِ تَقَدَّمَ التَّلاَمِيذُ
    إِلَى يَسُوعَ قَائِلِينَ: «فَمَنْ هُوَ أَعْظَمُ فِي مَلَكُوتِ
    السَّمَاوَاتِ؟» فَدَعَا يَسُوعُ إِلَيْهِ وَلَداً وَأَقَامَهُ فِي وَسَطِهِمْ
    وَقَالَ: «اَلْحَقَّ أَقُولُ لَكُمْ: إِنْ لَمْ تَرْجِعُوا وَتَصِيرُوا مِثْلَ
    الأَوْلاَدِ فَلَنْ تَدْخُلُوا مَلَكُوتَ السَّمَاوَاتِ. فَمَنْ وَضَعَ
    نَفْسَهُ مِثْلَ هَذَا الْوَلَدِ فَهُوَ الأَعْظَمُ فِي مَلَكُوتِ
    السَّمَاوَاتِ. وَمَنْ قَبِلَ وَلَداً وَاحِداً مِثْلَ هَذَا بِاسْمِي فَقَدْ
    قَبِلَنِي. وَمَنْ أَعْثَرَ أَحَدَ هَؤُلاَءِ الصِّغَارِ الْمُؤْمِنِينَ بِي
    فَخَيْرٌ لَهُ أَنْ يُعَلَّقَ فِي عُنُقِهِ حَجَرُ الرَّحَى وَيُغْرَقَ فِي
    لُجَّةِ الْبَحْرِ. وَيْلٌ لِلْعَالَمِ مِنَ الْعَثَرَاتِ. فَلاَ بُدَّ أَنْ
    تَأْتِيَ الْعَثَرَاتُ وَلَكِنْ وَيْلٌ لِذَلِكَ الإِنْسَانِ الَّذِي بِهِ
    تَأْتِي الْعَثْرَةُ. فَإِنْ أَعْثَرَتْكَ يَدُكَ أَوْ رِجْلُكَ فَاقْطَعْهَا
    وَأَلْقِهَا عَنْكَ. خَيْرٌ لَكَ أَنْ تَدْخُلَ الْحَيَاةَ أَعْرَجَ أَوْ
    أَقْطَعَ مِنْ أَنْ تُلْقَى فِي النَّارِ الأَبَدِيَّةِ وَلَكَ يَدَانِ أَوْ
    رِجْلاَنِ. وَإِنْ أَعْثَرَتْكَ عَيْنُكَ فَاقْلَعْهَا وَأَلْقِهَا عَنْكَ.
    خَيْرٌ لَكَ أَنْ تَدْخُلَ الْحَيَاةَ أَعْوَرَ مِنْ أَنْ تُلْقَى فِي
    جَهَنَّمَ النَّارِ وَلَكَ عَيْنَانِ."
