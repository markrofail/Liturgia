  english: "By faith Abraham, when he was tested, offered up Isaac, and he who had
    received the promises offered up his only begotten son, of whom it was said,
    \"In Isaac your seed shall be called,\" concluding that God was able to
    raise him up, even from the dead, from which he also received him in a
    figurative sense. By faith Isaac blessed Jacob and Esau concerning things to
    come. By faith Jacob, when he was dying, blessed each of the sons of Joseph,
    and worshiped, leaning on the top of his staff. By faith Joseph, when he was
    dying, made mention of the departure of the children of Israel, and gave
    instructions concerning his bones. By faith Moses, when he was born, was
    hidden three months by his parents, because they saw he was a beautiful
    child; and they were not afraid of the king's command. By faith Moses, when
    he became of age, refused to be called the son of Pharaoh's daughter,
    choosing rather to suffer affliction with the people of God than to enjoy
    the passing pleasures of sin, esteeming the reproach of Christ greater
    riches than the treasures in Egypt; for he looked to the reward. By faith he
    forsook Egypt, not fearing the wrath of the king; for he endured as seeing
    Him who is invisible. And so we have the prophetic word confirmed, which you
    do well to heed as a light that shines in a dark place, until the day dawns
    and the morning star rises in your hearts; knowing this first, that no
    prophecy of Scripture is of any private interpretation, for prophecy never
    came by the will of man, but holy men of God spoke as they were moved by the
    Holy Spirit. But there were also false prophets among the people, even as
    there will be false teachers among you, who will secretly bring in
    destructive heresies, even denying the Lord who bought them, and bring on
    themselves swift destruction. And many will follow their destructive ways,
    because of whom the way of truth will be blasphemed. By covetousness they
    will exploit you with deceptive words; for a long time their judgment has
    not been idle, and their destruction does not slumber. For if God did not
    spare the angels who sinned, but cast them down to hell and delivered them
    into chains of darkness, to be reserved for judgment; and did not spare the
    ancient world, but saved Noah, one of eight people, a preacher of
    righteousness, bringing in the flood on the world of the ungodly; and
    turning the cities of Sodom and Gomorrah into ashes, condemned them to
    destruction, making them an example to those who afterward would live
    ungodly; and delivered righteous Lot, who was oppressed by the filthy
    conduct of the wicked (for that righteous man, dwelling among them,
    tormented his righteous soul from day to day by seeing and hearing their
    lawless deeds)-- For Moses has had throughout many generations those who
    preach him in every city, being read in the synagogues every Sabbath.\" Then
    it pleased the apostles and elders, with the whole church, to send chosen
    men of their own company to Antioch with Paul and Barnabas, namely, Judas
    who was also named Barsabas, and Silas, leading men among the brethren. They
    wrote this letter by them: The apostles, the elders, and the brethren, To
    the brethren who are of the Gentiles in Antioch, Syria, and Cilicia:
    Greetings. Since we have heard that some who went out from us have troubled
    you with words, unsettling your souls, saying, \"You must be circumcised and
    keep the law\"--to whom we gave no such commandment-- it seemed good to us,
    being assembled with one accord, to send chosen men to you with our beloved
    Barnabas and Paul, men who have risked their lives for the name of our Lord
    Jesus Christ. We have therefore sent Judas and Silas, who will also report
    the same things by word of mouth. For it seemed good to the Holy Spirit, and
    to us, to lay upon you no greater burden than these necessary things: that
    you abstain from things offered to idols, from blood, from things strangled,
    and from sexual immorality. If you keep yourselves from these, you will do
    well. Farewell. Moses and Aaron were among His priests, And Samuel was among
    those who called upon His name; They called upon the LORD, and He answered
    them. He spoke to them in the cloudy pillar. \"But woe to you, scribes and
    Pharisees, hypocrites! For you shut up the kingdom of heaven against men;
    for you neither go in yourselves, nor do you allow those who are entering to
    go in. Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! For you devour widows'
    houses, and for a pretense make long prayers. Therefore you will receive
    greater condemnation. \"Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! For
    you travel land and sea to win one proselyte, and when he is won, you make
    him twice as much a son of hell as yourselves. \"Woe to you, blind guides,
    who say, \"Whoever swears by the temple, it is nothing; but whoever swears
    by the gold of the temple, he is obliged to perform it.' Fools and blind!
    For which is greater, the gold or the temple that sanctifies the gold?
    18And, \"Whoever swears by the altar, it is nothing; but whoever swears by
    the gift that is on it, he is obliged to perform it.' Fools and blind! For
    which is greater, the gift or the altar that sanctifies the gift? Therefore
    he who swears by the altar, swears by it and by all things on it. He who
    swears by the temple, swears by it and by Him who dwells in it. And he who
    swears by heaven, swears by the throne of God and by Him who sits on it.
    \"Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! For you pay tithe of mint
    and anise and cummin, and have neglected the weightier matters of the law:
    justice and mercy and faith. These you ought to have done, without leaving
    the others undone. Blind guides, who strain out a gnat and swallow a camel!
    \"Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! For you cleanse the outside
    of the cup and dish, but inside they are full of extortion and
    self-indulgence. Blind Pharisee, first cleanse the inside of the cup and
    dish, that the outside of them may be clean also. \"Woe to you, scribes and
    Pharisees, hypocrites! For you are like whitewashed tombs which indeed
    appear beautiful outwardly, but inside are full of dead men's bones and all
    uncleanness. Even so you also outwardly appear righteous to men, but inside
    you are full of hypocrisy and lawlessness. \"Woe to you, scribes and
    Pharisees, hypocrites! Because you build the tombs of the prophets and adorn
    the monuments of the righteous, and say, \"If we had lived in the days of
    our fathers, we would not have been partakers with them in the blood of the
    prophets.' \"Therefore you are witnesses against yourselves that you are
    sons of those who murdered the prophets. Fill up, then, the measure of your
    fathers' guilt. Serpents, brood of vipers! How can you escape the
    condemnation of hell? Therefore, indeed, I send you prophets, wise men, and
    scribes: some of them you will kill and crucify, and some of them you will
    scourge in your synagogues and persecute from city to city, that on you may
    come all the righteous blood shed on the earth, from the blood of righteous
    Abel to the blood of Zechariah, son of Berechiah, whom you murdered between
    the temple and the altar. Assuredly, I say to you, all these things will
    come upon this generation."

    إِنْ حَفِظْتُمْ أَنْفُسَكُمْ مِنْهَا فَنِعِمَّا تَفْعَلُونَ. كُونُوا
    مُعَافَيْنَ». مُوسَى وَهَارُونُ بَيْنَ كَهَنَتِهِ وَصَمُوئِيلُ بَيْنَ
    الَّذِينَ يَدْعُونَ بِاسْمِهِ. دَعُوا الرَّبَّ وَهُوَ اسْتَجَابَ لَهُمْ.
    بِعَمُودِ السَّحَابِ كَلَّمَهُمْ. حَفِظُوا شَهَادَاتِهِ وَالْفَرِيضَةَ
    الَّتِي أَعْطَاهُمْ."
