  english: "Meanwhile a Jew named Apollos, a native of Alexandria, came to
    Ephesus. He was a learned man, with a thorough knowledge of the Scriptures.
    He had been instructed in the way of the Lord, and he spoke with great
    fervor and taught about Jesus accurately, though he knew only the baptism of
    John. He began to speak boldly in the synagogue. When Priscilla and Aquila
    heard him, they invited him to their home and explained to him the way of
    God more adequately. When Apollos wanted to go to Achaia, the brothers
    encouraged him and wrote to the disciples there to welcome him. On arriving,
    he was a great help to those who by grace had believed. For he vigorously
    refuted the Jews in public debate, proving from the Scriptures that Jesus
    was the Christ. While Apollos was at Corinth, Paul took the road through the
    interior and arrived at Ephesus. There he found some disciples and asked
    them, \"Did you receive the Holy Spirit when you believed?\" They answered,
    \"No, we have not even heard that there is a Holy Spirit.\" So Paul asked,
    \"Then what baptism did you receive?\" \"John's baptism,\" they replied.
    Paul said, \"John's baptism was a baptism of repentance. He told the people
    to believe in the one coming after him, that is, in Jesus.\" On hearing
    this, they were baptized into the name of the Lord Jesus. When Paul placed
    his hands on them, the Holy Spirit came on them, and they spoke in tongues
    and prophesied. The mouth of the righteous man utters wisdom, and his tongue
    speaks what is just. The law of his God is in his heart; his feet do not
    slip. Jesus told his disciples: \"There was a rich man whose manager was
    accused of wasting his possessions. So he called him in and asked him, 'What
    is this I hear about you? Give an account of your management, because you
    cannot be manager any longer.' \"The manager said to himself, 'What shall I
    do now? My master is taking away my job. I'm not strong enough to dig, and
    I'm ashamed to beg-- I know what I'll do so that, when I lose my job here,
    people will welcome me into their houses.' \"So he called in each one of his
    master's debtors. He asked the first, 'How much do you owe my master?' \"
    'Eight hundred gallons of olive oil,' he replied. \"The manager told him,
    'Take your bill, sit down quickly, and make it four hundred.' \"Then he
    asked the second, 'And how much do you owe?' \" 'A thousand bushels of
    wheat,' he replied. \"He told him, 'Take your bill and make it eight
    hundred.' \"The master commended the dishonest manager because he had acted
    shrewdly. For the people of this world are more shrewd in dealing with their
    own kind than are the people of the light. I tell you, use worldly wealth to
    gain friends for yourselves, so that when it is gone, you will be welcomed
    into eternal dwellings. \"Whoever can be trusted with very little can also
    be trusted with much, and whoever is dishonest with very little will also be
    dishonest with much. So if you have not been trustworthy in handling worldly
    wealth, who will trust you with true riches? And if you have not been
    trustworthy with someone else's property, who will give you property of your
    own?"
  arabic: "فَمُ الصِّدِّيقِ يَلْهَجُ بِالْحِكْمَةِ وَلِسَانُهُ يَنْطِقُ
    بِالْحَقِّ. شَرِيعَةُ إِلَهِهِ فِي قَلْبِهِ. لاَ تَتَقَلْقَلُ خَطَوَاتُهُ.
    وَقَالَ أَيْضاً لِتَلاَمِيذِهِ: «كَانَ إِنْسَانٌ غَنِيٌّ لَهُ وَكِيلٌ
    فَوُشِيَ بِهِ إِلَيْهِ بِأَنَّهُ يُبَذِّرُ أَمْوَالَهُ. فَدَعَاهُ وَقَالَ
    لَهُ: مَا هَذَا الَّذِي أَسْمَعُ عَنْكَ؟ أَعْطِ حِسَابَ وَكَالَتِكَ لأَنَّكَ
    لاَ تَقْدِرُ أَنْ تَكُونَ وَكِيلاً بَعْدُ. فَقَالَ الْوَكِيلُ فِي نَفْسِهِ:
    مَاذَا أَفْعَلُ؟ لأَنَّ سَيِّدِي يَأْخُذُ مِنِّي الْوَكَالَةَ. لَسْتُ
    أَسْتَطِيعُ أَنْ أَنْقُبَ وَأَسْتَحِي أَنْ أَسْتَعْطِيَ. قَدْ عَلِمْتُ
    مَاذَا أَفْعَلُ حَتَّى إِذَا عُزِلْتُ عَنِ الْوَكَالَةِ يَقْبَلُونِي فِي
    بُيُوتِهِمْ. فَدَعَا كُلَّ وَاحِدٍ مِنْ مَدْيُونِي سَيِّدِهِ وَقَالَ
    لِلأَوَّلِ: كَمْ عَلَيْكَ لِسَيِّدِي؟ فَقَالَ: مِئَةُ بَثِّ زَيْتٍ. فَقَالَ
    لَهُ: خُذْ صَكَّكَ وَاجْلِسْ عَاجِلاً وَاكْتُبْ خَمْسِينَ. ثُمَّ قَالَ
    لِآخَرَ: وَأَنْتَ كَمْ عَلَيْكَ؟ فَقَالَ: مِئَةُ كُرِّ قَمْحٍ. فَقَالَ لَهُ:
    خُذْ صَكَّكَ وَاكْتُبْ ثَمَانِينَ. فَمَدَحَ السَّيِّدُ وَكِيلَ الظُّلْمِ
    إِذْ بِحِكْمَةٍ فَعَلَ لأَنَّ أَبْنَاءَ هَذَا الدَّهْرِ أَحْكَمُ مِنْ
    أَبْنَاءِ النُّورِ فِي جِيلِهِمْ. وَأَنَا أَقُولُ لَكُمُ: اصْنَعُوا لَكُمْ
    أَصْدِقَاءَ بِمَالِ الظُّلْمِ حَتَّى إِذَا فَنِيتُمْ يَقْبَلُونَكُمْ فِي
    الْمَظَالِّ الأَبَدِيَّةِ. اَلأَمِينُ فِي الْقَلِيلِ أَمِينٌ أَيْضاً فِي
    الْكَثِيرِ وَالظَّالِمُ فِي الْقَلِيلِ ظَالِمٌ أَيْضاً فِي الْكَثِيرِ.
    فَإِنْ لَمْ تَكُونُوا أُمَنَاءَ فِي مَالِ الظُّلْمِ فَمَنْ يَأْتَمِنُكُمْ
    عَلَى الْحَقِّ؟ وَإِنْ لَمْ تَكُونُوا أُمَنَاءَ فِي مَا هُوَ لِلْغَيْرِ
    فَمَنْ يُعْطِيكُمْ مَا هُوَ لَكُمْ؟"
