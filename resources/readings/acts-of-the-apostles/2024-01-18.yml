  english: "Now God worked unusual miracles by the hands of Paul, so that even
    handkerchiefs or aprons were brought from his body to the sick, and the
    diseases left them and the evil spirits went out of them. Then some of the
    itinerant Jewish exorcists took it upon themselves to call the name of the
    Lord Jesus over those who had evil spirits, saying, \"We exorcise you by the
    Jesus whom Paul preaches.\" Also there were seven sons of Sceva, a Jewish
    chief priest, who did so. And the evil spirit answered and said, \"Jesus I
    know, and Paul I know; but who are you?\" Then the man in whom the evil
    spirit was leaped on them, overpowered them, and prevailed against them, so
    that they fled out of that house naked and wounded. This became known both
    to all Jews and Greeks dwelling in Ephesus; and fear fell on them all, and
    the name of the Lord Jesus was magnified. And many who had believed came
    confessing and telling their deeds. Also, many of those who had practiced
    magic brought their books together and burned them in the sight of all. And
    they counted up the value of them, and it totaled fifty thousand pieces of
    silver. So the word of the Lord grew mightily and prevailed. Blessed is the
    man Who walks not in the counsel of the ungodly, Nor stands in the path of
    sinners, Nor sits in the seat of the scornful. And Jesus went about all
    Galilee, teaching in their synagogues, preaching the gospel of the kingdom,
    and healing all kinds of sickness and all kinds of disease among the people.
    Then His fame went throughout all Syria; and they brought to Him all sick
    people who were afflicted with various diseases and torments, and those who
    were demon-possessed, epileptics, and paralytics; and He healed them. Great
    multitudes followed Him--from Galilee, and from Decapolis, Jerusalem, Judea,
    and beyond the Jordan. And seeing the multitudes, He went up on a mountain,
    and when He was seated His disciples came to Him. Then He opened His mouth
    and taught them, saying: \"Blessed are the poor in spirit, For theirs is the
    kingdom of heaven. Blessed are those who mourn, For they shall be comforted.
    Blessed are the meek, For they shall inherit the earth. Blessed are those
    who hunger and thirst for righteousness, For they shall be filled. Blessed
    are the merciful, For they shall obtain mercy. Blessed are the pure in
    heart, For they shall see God. Blessed are the peacemakers, For they shall
    be called sons of God. Blessed are those who are persecuted for
    righteousness' sake, For theirs is the kingdom of heaven. \"Blessed are you
    when they revile and persecute you, and say all kinds of evil against you
    falsely for My sake. Rejoice and be exceedingly glad, for great is your
    reward in heaven, for so they persecuted the prophets who were before you.
    \"You are the salt of the earth; but if the salt loses its flavor, how shall
    it be seasoned? It is then good for nothing but to be thrown out and
    trampled underfoot by men. \"You are the light of the world. A city that is
    set on a hill cannot be hidden. Nor do they light a lamp and put it under a
    basket, but on a lampstand, and it gives light to all who are in the house.
    Let your light so shine before men, that they may see your good works and
    glorify your Father in heaven."
  arabic: "وَكَانَ اللهُ يَصْنَعُ عَلَى يَدَيْ بُولُسَ قُوَّاتٍ غَيْرَ
    الْمُعْتَادَةِ حَتَّى كَانَ يُؤْتَى عَنْ جَسَدِهِ بِمَنَادِيلَ أَوْ مَآزِرَ
    إِلَى الْمَرْضَى فَتَزُولُ عَنْهُمُ الأَمْرَاضُ وَتَخْرُجُ الأَرْوَاحُ
    الشِّرِّيرَةُ مِنْهُمْ. فَشَرَعَ قَوْمٌ مِنَ الْيَهُودِ الطَّوَّافِينَ
    الْمُعَزِّمِينَ أَنْ يُسَمُّوا عَلَى الَّذِينَ بِهِمِ الأَرْوَاحُ
    الشِّرِّيرَةُ بِاسْمِ الرَّبِّ يَسُوعَ قَائِلِينَ: «نُقْسِمُ عَلَيْكَ
    بِيَسُوعَ الَّذِي يَكْرِزُ بِهِ بُولُسُ!» وَكَانَ الَّذِينَ فَعَلُوا هَذَا
    سَبْعَةَ بَنِينَ لِسَكَاوَا رَجُلٍ يَهُودِيٍّ رَئِيسِ كَهَنَةٍ. فَقَالَ
    الرُّوحُ الشِّرِّيرُ لَهُمْ: «أَمَّا يَسُوعُ فَأَنَا أَعْرِفُهُ وَبُولُسُ
    أَنَا أَعْلَمُهُ وَأَمَّا أَنْتُمْ فَمَنْ أَنْتُمْ؟» فَوَثَبَ عَلَيْهِمُ
    الإِنْسَانُ الَّذِي كَانَ فِيهِ الرُّوحُ الشِّرِّيرُ وَغَلَبَهُمْ وَقَوِيَ
    عَلَيْهِمْ حَتَّى هَرَبُوا مِنْ ذَلِكَ الْبَيْتِ عُرَاةً وَمُجَرَّحِينَ.
    وَصَارَ هَذَا مَعْلُوماً عِنْدَ جَمِيعِ الْيَهُودِ وَالْيُونَانِيِّينَ
    السَّاكِنِينَ فِي أَفَسُسَ. فَوَقَعَ خَوْفٌ عَلَى جَمِيعِهِمْ وَكَانَ اسْمُ
    الرَّبِّ يَسُوعَ يَتَعَظَّمُ. وَكَانَ كَثِيرُونَ مِنَ الَّذِينَ آمَنُوا
    يَأْتُونَ مُقِرِّينَ وَمُخْبِرِينَ بِأَفْعَالِهِمْ وَكَانَ كَثِيرُونَ مِنَ
    الَّذِينَ يَسْتَعْمِلُونَ السِّحْرَ يَجْمَعُونَ الْكُتُبَ وَيُحَرِّقُونَهَا
    أَمَامَ الْجَمِيعِ. وَحَسَبُوا أَثْمَانَهَا فَوَجَدُوهَا خَمْسِينَ أَلْفاً
    مِنَ الْفِضَّةِ. هَكَذَا كَانَتْ كَلِمَةُ الرَّبِّ تَنْمُو وَتَقْوَى
    بِشِدَّةٍ. طُوبَى لِلرَّجُلِ الَّذِي لَمْ يَسْلُكْ فِي مَشُورَةِ الأَشْرَارِ
    وَفِي طَرِيقِ الْخُطَاةِ لَمْ يَقِفْ وَفِي مَجْلِسِ الْمُسْتَهْزِئِينَ لَمْ
    يَجْلِسْ. وَكَانَ يَسُوعُ يَطُوفُ كُلَّ الْجَلِيلِ يُعَلِّمُ فِي
    مَجَامِعِهِمْ وَيَكْرِزُ بِبِشَارَةِ الْمَلَكُوتِ وَيَشْفِي كُلَّ مَرَضٍ
    وَكُلَّ ضَعْفٍ فِي الشَّعْبِ."
