  english: Psalm 99:6-7
  arabic: "مزامير ٩٩ : ٦-٧"
text:
  english: Moses and Aaron were among His priests, And Samuel was among those who
    called upon His name; They called upon the LORD, and He answered them. He
    spoke to them in the cloudy pillar; They kept His testimonies and the
    ordinance He gave them.
  arabic: مُوسَى وَهَارُونُ بَيْنَ كَهَنَتِهِ وَصَمُوئِيلُ بَيْنَ الَّذِينَ
    يَدْعُونَ بِاسْمِهِ. دَعُوا الرَّبَّ وَهُوَ اسْتَجَابَ لَهُمْ. بِعَمُودِ
    السَّحَابِ كَلَّمَهُمْ. حَفِظُوا شَهَادَاتِهِ وَالْفَرِيضَةَ الَّتِي
    أَعْطَاهُمْ.
