  english: Then He came to Capernaum. And when He was in the house He asked them,
    "What was it you disputed among yourselves on the road?" But they kept
    silent, for on the road they had disputed among themselves who would be the
    greatest. And He sat down, called the twelve, and said to them, "If anyone
    desires to be first, he shall be last of all and servant of all." Then He
    took a little child and set him in the midst of them. And when He had taken
    him in His arms, He said to them, "Whoever receives one of these little
    children in My name receives Me; and whoever receives Me, receives not Me
    but Him who sent Me." Now John answered Him, saying, "Teacher, we saw
    someone who does not follow us casting out demons in Your name, and we
    forbade him because he does not follow us." But Jesus said, "Do not forbid
    him, for no one who works a miracle in My name can soon afterward speak evil
    of Me. For he who is not against us is on our side. For whoever gives you a
    cup of water to drink in My name, because you belong to Christ, assuredly, I
    say to you, he will by no means lose his reward.
  arabic: "فَلَمَّا أُخْرِجَ الشَّيْطَانُ تَكَلَّمَ الأَخْرَسُ فَتَعَجَّبَ
    الْجُمُوعُ قَائِلِينَ: «لَمْ يَظْهَرْ قَطُّ مِثْلُ هَذَا فِي إِسْرَائِيلَ!»
    أَمَّا الْفَرِّيسِيُّونَ فَقَالُوا: «بِرَئِيسِ الشَّيَاطِينِ يُخْرِجُ
    الشَّيَاطِينَ». وَكَانَ يَسُوعُ يَطُوفُ الْمُدُنَ كُلَّهَا وَالْقُرَى
    يُعَلِّمُ فِي مَجَامِعِهَا وَيَكْرِزُ بِبِشَارَةِ الْمَلَكُوتِ وَيَشْفِي
    كُلَّ مَرَضٍ وَكُلَّ ضُعْفٍ فِي الشَّعْبِ. وَلَمَّا رَأَى الْجُمُوعَ
    تَحَنَّنَ عَلَيْهِمْ إِذْ كَانُوا مُنْزَعِجِينَ وَمُنْطَرِحِينَ كَغَنَمٍ لاَ
    رَاعِيَ لَهَا. حِينَئِذٍ قَالَ لِتَلاَمِيذِهِ: «الْحَصَادُ كَثِيرٌ وَلَكِنَّ
    الْفَعَلَةَ قَلِيلُونَ. فَاطْلُبُوا مِنْ رَبِّ الْحَصَادِ أَنْ يُرْسِلَ
    فَعَلَةً إِلَى حَصَادِهِ»."
