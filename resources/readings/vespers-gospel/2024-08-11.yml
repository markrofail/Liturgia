  english: Immediately He made His disciples get into the boat and go before Him
    to the other side, to Bethsaida, while He sent the multitude away. And when
    He had sent them away, He departed to the mountain to pray. Now when evening
    came, the boat was in the middle of the sea; and He was alone on the land.
    Then He saw them straining at rowing, for the wind was against them. Now
    about the fourth watch of the night He came to them, walking on the sea, and
    would have passed them by. And when they saw Him walking on the sea, they
    supposed it was a ghost, and cried out; for they all saw Him and were
    troubled. But immediately He talked with them and said to them, "Be of good
    cheer! It is I; do not be afraid." Then He went up into the boat to them,
    and the wind ceased. And they were greatly amazed in themselves beyond
    measure, and marveled. For they had not understood about the loaves, because
    their heart was hardened. When they had crossed over, they came to the land
    of Gennesaret and anchored there. And when they came out of the boat,
    immediately the people recognized Him, ran through that whole surrounding
    region, and began to carry about on beds those who were sick to wherever
    they heard He was. Wherever He entered, into villages, cities, or the
    country, they laid the sick in the marketplaces, and begged Him that they
    might just touch the hem of His garment. And as many as touched Him were
    made well.
  arabic: "وَلِلْوَقْتِ أَلْزَمَ تَلاَمِيذَهُ أَنْ يَدْخُلُوا السَّفِينَةَ
    وَيَسْبِقُوا إِلَى الْعَبْرِ إِلَى بَيْتِ صَيْدَا حَتَّى يَكُونَ قَدْ صَرَفَ
    الْجَمْعَ. وَبَعْدَمَا وَدَّعَهُمْ مَضَى إِلَى الْجَبَلِ لِيُصَلِّيَ.
    وَلَمَّا صَارَ الْمَسَاءُ كَانَتِ السَّفِينَةُ فِي وَسَطِ الْبَحْرِ وَهُوَ
    عَلَى الْبَرِّ وَحْدَهُ. وَرَآهُمْ مُعَذَّبِينَ فِي الْجَذْفِ لأَنَّ
    الرِّيحَ كَانَتْ ضِدَّهُمْ. وَنَحْوَ الْهَزِيعِ الرَّابِعِ مِنَ اللَّيْلِ
    أَتَاهُمْ مَاشِياً عَلَى الْبَحْرِ وَأَرَادَ أَنْ يَتَجَاوَزَهُمْ. فَلَمَّا
    رَأَوْهُ مَاشِياً عَلَى الْبَحْرِ ظَنُّوهُ خَيَالاً فَصَرَخُوا لأَنَّ
    الْجَمِيعَ رَأَوْهُ وَاضْطَرَبُوا. فَلِلْوَقْتِ قَالَ لَهُمْ: «ثِقُوا. أَنَا
    هُوَ. لاَ تَخَافُوا». فَصَعِدَ إِلَيْهِمْ إِلَى السَّفِينَةِ فَسَكَنَتِ
    الرِّيحُ فَبُهِتُوا وَتَعَجَّبُوا فِي أَنْفُسِهِمْ جِدّاً إِلَى الْغَايَةِ
    لأَنَّهُمْ لَمْ يَفْهَمُوا بِالأَرْغِفَةِ إِذْ كَانَتْ قُلُوبُهُمْ
    غَلِيظَةً. فَلَمَّا عَبَرُوا جَاءُوا إِلَى أَرْضِ جَنِّيسَارَتَ وَأَرْسَوْا.
    وَلَمَّا خَرَجُوا مِنَ السَّفِينَةِ لِلْوَقْتِ عَرَفُوهُ فَطَافُوا جَمِيعَ
    تِلْكَ الْكُورَةِ الْمُحِيطَةِ وَابْتَدَأُوا يَحْمِلُونَ الْمَرْضَى عَلَى
    أَسِرَّةٍ إِلَى حَيْثُ سَمِعُوا أَنَّهُ هُنَاكَ. وَحَيْثُمَا دَخَلَ إِلَى
    قُرىً أَوْ مُدُنٍ أَوْ ضِيَاعٍ وَضَعُوا الْمَرْضَى فِي الأَسْوَاقِ
    وَطَلَبُوا إِلَيْهِ أَنْ يَلْمِسُوا وَلَوْ هُدْبَ ثَوْبِهِ. وَكُلُّ مَنْ
    لَمَسَهُ شُفِيَ!"
