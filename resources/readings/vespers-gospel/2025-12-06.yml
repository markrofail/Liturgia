text:
  english: And as He walked by the Sea of Galilee, He saw Simon and Andrew his
    brother casting a net into the sea; for they were fishermen. Then Jesus said
    to them, "Follow Me, and I will make you become fishers of men." They
    immediately left their nets and followed Him. When He had gone a little
    farther from there, He saw James the son of Zebedee, and John his brother,
    who also were in the boat mending their nets. And immediately He called
    them, and they left their father Zebedee in the boat with the hired
    servants, and went after Him. Then they went into Capernaum, and immediately
    on the Sabbath He entered the synagogue and taught. And they were astonished
    at His teaching, for He taught them as one having authority, and not as the
    scribes.
  arabic: "وَفِيمَا هُوَ يَمْشِي عِنْدَ بَحْرِ الْجَلِيلِ أَبْصَرَ سِمْعَانَ
    وَأَنْدَرَاوُسَ أَخَاهُ يُلْقِيَانِ شَبَكَةً فِي الْبَحْرِ فَإِنَّهُمَا
    كَانَا صَيَّادَيْنِ. فَقَالَ لَهُمَا يَسُوعُ: «هَلُمَّ وَرَائِي
    فَأَجْعَلُكُمَا تَصِيرَانِ صَيَّادَيِ النَّاسِ». فَلِلْوَقْتِ تَرَكَا
    شِبَاكَهُمَا وَتَبِعَاهُ. ثُمَّ اجْتَازَ مِنْ هُنَاكَ قَلِيلاً فَرَأَى
    يَعْقُوبَ بْنَ زَبْدِي وَيُوحَنَّا أَخَاهُ وَهُمَا فِي السَّفِينَةِ
    يُصْلِحَانِ الشِّبَاكَ. فَدَعَاهُمَا لِلْوَقْتِ. فَتَرَكَا أَبَاهُمَا
    زَبْدِي فِي السَّفِينَةِ مَعَ الأَجْرَى وَذَهَبَا وَرَاءَهُ. ثُمَّ دَخَلُوا
    كَفْرَنَاحُومَ وَلِلْوَقْتِ دَخَلَ الْمَجْمَعَ فِي السَّبْتِ وَصَارَ
    يُعَلِّمُ. فَبُهِتُوا مِنْ تَعْلِيمِهِ لأَنَّهُ كَانَ يُعَلِّمُهُمْ كَمَنْ
    لَهُ سُلْطَانٌ وَلَيْسَ كَالْكَتَبَةِ."
