  english: "Young men, in the same way be submissive to those who are older. All
    of you, clothe yourselves with humility toward one another, because, \"God
    opposes the proud but gives grace to the humble.\" Humble yourselves,
    therefore, under God's mighty hand, that he may lift you up in due time.
    Cast all your anxiety on him because he cares for you. Be self-controlled
    and alert. Your enemy the devil prowls around like a roaring lion looking
    for someone to devour. Resist him, standing firm in the faith, because you
    know that your brothers throughout the world are undergoing the same kind of
    sufferings. And the God of all grace, who called you to his eternal glory in
    Christ, after you have suffered a little while, will himself restore you and
    make you strong, firm and steadfast. To him be the power for ever and ever.
    Amen. With the help of Silas, whom I regard as a faithful brother, I have
    written to you briefly, encouraging you and testifying that this is the true
    grace of God. Stand fast in it. She who is in Babylon, chosen together with
    you, sends you her greetings, and so does my son Mark. Greet one another
    with a kiss of love. Peace to all of you who are in Christ. Meanwhile a Jew
    named Apollos, a native of Alexandria, came to Ephesus. He was a learned
    man, with a thorough knowledge of the Scriptures. He had been instructed in
    the way of the Lord, and he spoke with great fervor and taught about Jesus
    accurately, though he knew only the baptism of John. He began to speak
    boldly in the synagogue. When Priscilla and Aquila heard him, they invited
    him to their home and explained to him the way of God more adequately. When
    Apollos wanted to go to Achaia, the brothers encouraged him and wrote to the
    disciples there to welcome him. On arriving, he was a great help to those
    who by grace had believed. For he vigorously refuted the Jews in public
    debate, proving from the Scriptures that Jesus was the Christ. While Apollos
    was at Corinth, Paul took the road through the interior and arrived at
    Ephesus. There he found some disciples and asked them, \"Did you receive the
    Holy Spirit when you believed?\" They answered, \"No, we have not even heard
    that there is a Holy Spirit.\" So Paul asked, \"Then what baptism did you
    receive?\" \"John's baptism,\" they replied. Paul said, \"John's baptism was
    a baptism of repentance. He told the people to believe in the one coming
    after him, that is, in Jesus.\" On hearing this, they were baptized into the
    name of the Lord Jesus. When Paul placed his hands on them, the Holy Spirit
    came on them, and they spoke in tongues and prophesied. The mouth of the
    righteous man utters wisdom, and his tongue speaks what is just. The law of
    his God is in his heart; his feet do not slip. Jesus told his disciples:
    \"There was a rich man whose manager was accused of wasting his possessions.
    So he called him in and asked him, 'What is this I hear about you? Give an
    account of your management, because you cannot be manager any longer.' \"The
    manager said to himself, 'What shall I do now? My master is taking away my
    job. I'm not strong enough to dig, and I'm ashamed to beg-- I know what I'll
    do so that, when I lose my job here, people will welcome me into their
    houses.' \"So he called in each one of his master's debtors. He asked the
    first, 'How much do you owe my master?' \" 'Eight hundred gallons of olive
    oil,' he replied. \"The manager told him, 'Take your bill, sit down quickly,
    and make it four hundred.' \"Then he asked the second, 'And how much do you
    owe?' \" 'A thousand bushels of wheat,' he replied. \"He told him, 'Take
    your bill and make it eight hundred.' \"The master commended the dishonest
    manager because he had acted shrewdly. For the people of this world are more
    shrewd in dealing with their own kind than are the people of the light. I
    tell you, use worldly wealth to gain friends for yourselves, so that when it
    is gone, you will be welcomed into eternal dwellings. \"Whoever can be
    trusted with very little can also be trusted with much, and whoever is
    dishonest with very little will also be dishonest with much. So if you have
    not been trustworthy in handling worldly wealth, who will trust you with
    true riches? And if you have not been trustworthy with someone else's
    property, who will give you property of your own?"

    خَاضِعِينَ بَعْضُكُمْ لِبَعْضٍ، وَتَسَرْبَلُوا بِالتَّوَاضُعِ، لأَنَّ اللهَ
    يُقَاوِمُ الْمُسْتَكْبِرِينَ، وَأَمَّا الْمُتَوَاضِعُونَ فَيُعْطِيهِمْ
    نِعْمَةً. فَتَوَاضَعُوا تَحْتَ يَدِ اللهِ الْقَوِيَّةِ لِكَيْ يَرْفَعَكُمْ
    فِي حِينِهِ، مُلْقِينَ كُلَّ هَمِّكُمْ عَلَيْهِ لأَنَّهُ هُوَ يَعْتَنِي
    بِكُمْ. اُصْحُوا وَاسْهَرُوا لأَنَّ إِبْلِيسَ خَصْمَكُمْ كَأَسَدٍ زَائِرٍ،
    يَجُولُ مُلْتَمِساً مَنْ يَبْتَلِعُهُ هُوَ. فَقَاوِمُوهُ رَاسِخِينَ فِي
    الإِيمَانِ، عَالِمِينَ أَنَّ نَفْسَ هَذِهِ الآلاَمِ تُجْرَى عَلَى
    إِخْوَتِكُمُ الَّذِينَ فِي الْعَالَمِ. وَإِلَهُ كُلِّ نِعْمَةٍ الَّذِي
    دَعَانَا إِلَى مَجْدِهِ الأَبَدِيِّ فِي الْمَسِيحِ يَسُوعَ، بَعْدَمَا
    تَأَلَّمْتُمْ يَسِيراً، هُوَ يُكَمِّلُكُمْ، وَيُثَبِّتُكُمْ، وَيُقَوِّيكُمْ،
    وَيُمَكِّنُكُمْ. لَهُ الْمَجْدُ وَالسُّلْطَانُ إِلَى أَبَدِ الآبِدِينَ.
    آمِينَ. بِيَدِ سِلْوَانُسَ الأَخِ الأَمِينِ، كَمَا أَظُنُّ كَتَبْتُ
    إِلَيْكُمْ بِكَلِمَاتٍ قَلِيلَةٍ وَاعِظاً وَشَاهِداً، أَنَّ هَذِهِ هِيَ
    نِعْمَةُ اللهِ الْحَقِيقِيَّةُ الَّتِي فِيهَا تَقُومُونَ. تُسَلِّمُ
    عَلَيْكُمُ الَّتِي فِي بَابِلَ الْمُخْتَارَةُ مَعَكُمْ، وَمَرْقُسُ ابْنِي.
    سَلِّمُوا بَعْضُكُمْ عَلَى بَعْضٍ بِقُبْلَةِ الْمَحَبَّةِ. سَلاَمٌ لَكُمْ
    جَمِيعِكُمُ الَّذِينَ فِي الْمَسِيحِ يَسُوعَ. آمِينَ. فَمُ الصِّدِّيقِ
    يَلْهَجُ بِالْحِكْمَةِ وَلِسَانُهُ يَنْطِقُ بِالْحَقِّ. شَرِيعَةُ إِلَهِهِ
    فِي قَلْبِهِ. لاَ تَتَقَلْقَلُ خَطَوَاتُهُ. وَقَالَ أَيْضاً لِتَلاَمِيذِهِ:
    «كَانَ إِنْسَانٌ غَنِيٌّ لَهُ وَكِيلٌ فَوُشِيَ بِهِ إِلَيْهِ بِأَنَّهُ
    يُبَذِّرُ أَمْوَالَهُ. فَدَعَاهُ وَقَالَ لَهُ: مَا هَذَا الَّذِي أَسْمَعُ
    عَنْكَ؟ أَعْطِ حِسَابَ وَكَالَتِكَ لأَنَّكَ لاَ تَقْدِرُ أَنْ تَكُونَ
    وَكِيلاً بَعْدُ. فَقَالَ الْوَكِيلُ فِي نَفْسِهِ: مَاذَا أَفْعَلُ؟ لأَنَّ
    سَيِّدِي يَأْخُذُ مِنِّي الْوَكَالَةَ. لَسْتُ أَسْتَطِيعُ أَنْ أَنْقُبَ
    وَأَسْتَحِي أَنْ أَسْتَعْطِيَ. قَدْ عَلِمْتُ مَاذَا أَفْعَلُ حَتَّى إِذَا
    عُزِلْتُ عَنِ الْوَكَالَةِ يَقْبَلُونِي فِي بُيُوتِهِمْ. فَدَعَا كُلَّ
    وَاحِدٍ مِنْ مَدْيُونِي سَيِّدِهِ وَقَالَ لِلأَوَّلِ: كَمْ عَلَيْكَ
    لِسَيِّدِي؟ فَقَالَ: مِئَةُ بَثِّ زَيْتٍ. فَقَالَ لَهُ: خُذْ صَكَّكَ
    وَاجْلِسْ عَاجِلاً وَاكْتُبْ خَمْسِينَ. ثُمَّ قَالَ لِآخَرَ: وَأَنْتَ كَمْ
    عَلَيْكَ؟ فَقَالَ: مِئَةُ كُرِّ قَمْحٍ. فَقَالَ لَهُ: خُذْ صَكَّكَ وَاكْتُبْ
    ثَمَانِينَ. فَمَدَحَ السَّيِّدُ وَكِيلَ الظُّلْمِ إِذْ بِحِكْمَةٍ فَعَلَ
    لأَنَّ أَبْنَاءَ هَذَا الدَّهْرِ أَحْكَمُ مِنْ أَبْنَاءِ النُّورِ فِي
    جِيلِهِمْ. وَأَنَا أَقُولُ لَكُمُ: اصْنَعُوا لَكُمْ أَصْدِقَاءَ بِمَالِ
    الظُّلْمِ حَتَّى إِذَا فَنِيتُمْ يَقْبَلُونَكُمْ فِي الْمَظَالِّ
    الأَبَدِيَّةِ. اَلأَمِينُ فِي الْقَلِيلِ أَمِينٌ أَيْضاً فِي الْكَثِيرِ
    وَالظَّالِمُ فِي الْقَلِيلِ ظَالِمٌ أَيْضاً فِي الْكَثِيرِ. فَإِنْ لَمْ
    تَكُونُوا أُمَنَاءَ فِي مَالِ الظُّلْمِ فَمَنْ يَأْتَمِنُكُمْ عَلَى
    الْحَقِّ؟ وَإِنْ لَمْ تَكُونُوا أُمَنَاءَ فِي مَا هُوَ لِلْغَيْرِ فَمَنْ
    يُعْطِيكُمْ مَا هُوَ لَكُمْ؟"
