  english: "You carry them away like a flood; They are like a sleep. In the
    morning they are like grass which grows up: For we have been consumed by
    Your anger, And by Your wrath we are terrified."
  arabic: جَرَفْتَهُمْ. كَسِنَةٍ يَكُونُونَ. بِالْغَدَاةِ كَعُشْبٍ يَزُولُ.
    لأَنَّنَا قَدْ فَنِينَا بِسَخَطِكَ وَبِغَضَبِكَ ارْتَعَبْنَا.
