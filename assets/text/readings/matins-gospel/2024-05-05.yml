  english: Very early in the morning, on the first day of the week, they came to
    the tomb when the sun had risen. And they said among themselves, "Who will
    roll away the stone from the door of the tomb for us?" But when they looked
    up, they saw that the stone had been rolled away--for it was very large. And
    entering the tomb, they saw a young man clothed in a long white robe sitting
    on the right side; and they were alarmed. But he said to them, "Do not be
    alarmed. You seek Jesus of Nazareth, who was crucified. He is risen! He is
    not here. See the place where they laid Him. But go, tell His disciples--and
    Peter--that He is going before you into Galilee; there you will see Him, as
    He said to you." So they went out quickly and fled from the tomb, for they
    trembled and were amazed. And they said nothing to anyone, for they were
    afraid. Now when He rose early on the first day of the week, He appeared
    first to Mary Magdalene, out of whom He had cast seven demons. She went and
    told those who had been with Him, as they mourned and wept. And when they
    heard that He was alive and had been seen by her, they did not believe.
  arabic: "وَبَاكِراً جِدّاً فِي أَوَّلِ الأُسْبُوعِ أَتَيْنَ إِلَى الْقَبْرِ إِذْ
    طَلَعَتِ الشَّمْسُ. وَكُنَّ يَقُلْنَ فِيمَا بَيْنَهُنَّ: «مَنْ يُدَحْرِجُ
    لَنَا الْحَجَرَ عَنْ بَابِ الْقَبْرِ؟» فَتَطَلَّعْنَ وَرَأَيْنَ أَنَّ
    الْحَجَرَ قَدْ دُحْرِجَ! لأَنَّهُ كَانَ عَظِيماً جِدّاً. وَلَمَّا دَخَلْنَ
    الْقَبْرَ رَأَيْنَ شَابّاً جَالِساً عَنِ الْيَمِينِ لاَبِساً حُلَّةً
    بَيْضَاءَ فَانْدَهَشْنَ. فَقَالَ لَهُنَّ: «لاَ تَنْدَهِشْنَ! أَنْتُنَّ
    تَطْلُبْنَ يَسُوعَ النَّاصِرِيَّ الْمَصْلُوبَ. قَدْ قَامَ! لَيْسَ هُوَ
    هَهُنَا. هُوَذَا الْمَوْضِعُ الَّذِي وَضَعُوهُ فِيهِ. لَكِنِ اذْهَبْنَ
    وَقُلْنَ لِتَلاَمِيذِهِ وَلِبُطْرُسَ إِنَّهُ يَسْبِقُكُمْ إِلَى الْجَلِيلِ.
    هُنَاكَ تَرَوْنَهُ كَمَا قَالَ لَكُمْ». فَخَرَجْنَ سَرِيعاً وَهَرَبْنَ مِنَ
    الْقَبْرِ لأَنَّ الرِّعْدَةَ وَالْحَيْرَةَ أَخَذَتَاهُنَّ. وَلَمْ يَقُلْنَ
    لأَحَدٍ شَيْئاً لأَنَّهُنَّ كُنَّ خَائِفَاتٍ. وَبَعْدَمَا قَامَ بَاكِراً فِي
    أَوَّلِ الأُسْبُوعِ ظَهَرَ أَوَّلاً لِمَرْيَمَ الْمَجْدَلِيَّةِ الَّتِي
    كَانَ قَدْ أَخْرَجَ مِنْهَا سَبْعَةَ شَيَاطِينَ. فَذَهَبَتْ هَذِهِ
    وَأَخْبَرَتِ الَّذِينَ كَانُوا مَعَهُ وَهُمْ يَنُوحُونَ وَيَبْكُونَ.
    فَلَمَّا سَمِعَ أُولَئِكَ أَنَّهُ حَيٌّ وَقَدْ نَظَرَتْهُ لَمْ يُصَدِّقُوا."
