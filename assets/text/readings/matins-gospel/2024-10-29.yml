  english: Lk 7:11-17
  arabic: "لوقا ٧ : ١١-١٧"
text:
  english: Now it happened, the day after, that He went into a city called Nain;
    and many of His disciples went with Him, and a large crowd. And when He came
    near the gate of the city, behold, a dead man was being carried out, the
    only son of his mother; and she was a widow. And a large crowd from the city
    was with her. When the Lord saw her, He had compassion on her and said to
    her, "Do not weep." Then He came and touched the open coffin, and those who
    carried him stood still. And He said, "Young man, I say to you, arise." So
    he who was dead sat up and began to speak. And He presented him to his
    mother. Then fear came upon all, and they glorified God, saying, "A great
    prophet has risen up among us"; and, "God has visited His people." And this
    report about Him went throughout all Judea and all the surrounding region.
  arabic: "وَفِي الْيَوْمِ التَّالِي ذَهَبَ إِلَى مَدِينَةٍ تُدْعَى نَايِينَ
    وَذَهَبَ مَعَهُ كَثِيرُونَ مِنْ تَلاَمِيذِهِ وَجَمْعٌ كَثِيرٌ. فَلَمَّا
    اقْتَرَبَ إِلَى بَابِ الْمَدِينَةِ إِذَا مَيْتٌ مَحْمُولٌ ابْنٌ وَحِيدٌ
    لأُمِّهِ وَهِيَ أَرْمَلَةٌ وَمَعَهَا جَمْعٌ كَثِيرٌ مِنَ الْمَدِينَةِ.
    فَلَمَّا رَآهَا الرَّبُّ تَحَنَّنَ عَلَيْهَا وَقَالَ لَهَا: «لاَ تَبْكِي».
    ثُمَّ تَقَدَّمَ وَلَمَسَ النَّعْشَ فَوَقَفَ الْحَامِلُونَ. فَقَالَ:
    «أَيُّهَا الشَّابُّ لَكَ أَقُولُ قُمْ». فَجَلَسَ الْمَيْتُ وَابْتَدَأَ
    يَتَكَلَّمُ فَدَفَعَهُ إِلَى أُمِّهِ. فَأَخَذَ الْجَمِيعَ خَوْفٌ وَمَجَّدُوا
    اللهَ قَائِلِينَ: «قَدْ قَامَ فِينَا نَبِيٌّ عَظِيمٌ وَافْتَقَدَ اللهُ
    شَعْبَهُ». وَخَرَجَ هَذَا الْخَبَرُ عَنْهُ فِي كُلِّ الْيَهُودِيَّةِ وَفِي
    جَمِيعِ الْكُورَةِ الْمُحِيطَةِ."
