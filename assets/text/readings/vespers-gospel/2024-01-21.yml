  english: When all the people were baptized, it came to pass that Jesus also was
    baptized; and while He prayed, the heaven was opened. And the Holy Spirit
    descended in bodily form like a dove upon Him, and a voice came from heaven
    which said, "You are My beloved Son; in You I am well pleased."
  arabic: "وَلَمَّا اعْتَمَدَ جَمِيعُ الشَّعْبِ اعْتَمَدَ يَسُوعُ أَيْضاً. وَإِذْ
    كَانَ يُصَلِّي انْفَتَحَتِ السَّمَاءُ وَنَزَلَ عَلَيْهِ الرُّوحُ الْقُدُسُ
    بِهَيْئَةٍ جِسْمِيَّةٍ مِثْلِ حَمَامَةٍ. وَكَانَ صَوْتٌ مِنَ السَّمَاءِ
    قَائِلاً: «أَنْتَ ابْنِي الْحَبِيبُ بِكَ سُرِرْتُ!»."
