  english: 'Jude, a bondservant of Jesus Christ, and brother of James, To those
    who are called, sanctified by God the Father, and preserved in Jesus Christ:
    Mercy, peace, and love be multiplied to you. Beloved, while I was very
    diligent to write to you concerning our common salvation, I found it
    necessary to write to you exhorting you to contend earnestly for the faith
    which was once for all delivered to the saints. For certain men have crept
    in unnoticed, who long ago were marked out for this condemnation, ungodly
    men, who turn the grace of our God into lewdness and deny the only Lord God
    and our Lord Jesus Christ. But I want to remind you, though you once knew
    this, that the Lord, having saved the people out of the land of Egypt,
    afterward destroyed those who did not believe. And the angels who did not
    keep their proper domain, but left their own abode, He has reserved in
    everlasting chains under darkness for the judgment of the great day; as
    Sodom and Gomorrah, and the cities around them in a similar manner to these,
    having given themselves over to sexual immorality and gone after strange
    flesh, are set forth as an example, suffering the vengeance of eternal fire.
    Likewise also these dreamers defile the flesh, reject authority, and speak
    evil of dignitaries. Yet Michael the archangel, in contending with the
    devil, when he disputed about the body of Moses, dared not bring against him
    a reviling accusation, but said, "The Lord rebuke you!" But these speak evil
    of whatever they do not know; and whatever they know naturally, like brute
    beasts, in these things they corrupt themselves. Woe to them! For they have
    gone in the way of Cain, have run greedily in the error of Balaam for
    profit, and perished in the rebellion of Korah. These are spots in your love
    feasts, while they feast with you without fear, serving only themselves.
    They are clouds without water, carried about by the winds; late autumn trees
    without fruit, twice dead, pulled up by the roots; raging waves of the sea,
    foaming up their own shame; wandering stars for whom is reserved the
    blackness of darkness forever. Now Enoch, the seventh from Adam, prophesied
    about these men also, saying, "Behold, the Lord comes with ten thousands of
    His saints, to execute judgment on all, to convict all who are ungodly among
    them of all their ungodly deeds which they have committed in an ungodly way,
    and of all the harsh things which ungodly sinners have spoken against Him."
    These are grumblers, complainers, walking according to their own lusts; and
    they mouth great swelling words, flattering people to gain advantage. But
    you, beloved, remember the words which were spoken before by the apostles of
    our Lord Jesus Christ: how they told you that there would be mockers in the
    last time who would walk according to their own ungodly lusts. These are
    sensual persons, who cause divisions, not having the Spirit. But you,
    beloved, building yourselves up on your most holy faith, praying in the Holy
    Spirit, keep yourselves in the love of God, looking for the mercy of our
    Lord Jesus Christ unto eternal life. And on some have compassion, making a
    distinction; but others save with fear, pulling them out of the fire, hating
    even the garment defiled by the flesh. Now to Him who is able to keep you
    from stumbling, And to present you faultless Before the presence of His
    glory with exceeding joy, To God our Savior, Who alone is wise, Be glory and
    majesty, Dominion and power, Both now and forever. Amen. But at night an
    angel of the Lord opened the prison doors and brought them out, and said,
    "Go, stand in the temple and speak to the people all the words of this
    life." And when they heard that, they entered the temple early in the
    morning and taught. But the high priest and those with him came and called
    the council together, with all the elders of the children of Israel, and
    sent to the prison to have them brought. But when the officers came and did
    not find them in the prison, they returned and reported, saying, "Indeed we
    found the prison shut securely, and the guards standing outside before the
    doors; but when we opened them, we found no one inside!" Oh, give thanks to
    the LORD, for He is good! For His mercy endures forever. Let Israel now say,
    "His mercy endures forever." At that time the disciples came to Jesus,
    saying, "Who then is greatest in the kingdom of heaven?" Then Jesus called a
    little child to Him, set him in the midst of them, and said, "Assuredly, I
    say to you, unless you are converted and become as little children, you will
    by no means enter the kingdom of heaven. Therefore whoever humbles himself
    as this little child is the greatest in the kingdom of heaven. Whoever
    receives one little child like this in My name receives Me. "Whoever causes
    one of these little ones who believe in Me to sin, it would be better for
    him if a millstone were hung around his neck, and he were drowned in the
    depth of the sea. Woe to the world because of offenses! For offenses must
    come, but woe to that man by whom the offense comes! "If your hand or foot
    causes you to sin, cut it off and cast it from you. It is better for you to
    enter into life lame or maimed, rather than having two hands or two feet, to
    be cast into the everlasting fire. And if your eye causes you to sin, pluck
    it out and cast it from you. It is better for you to enter into life with
    one eye, rather than having two eyes, to be cast into hell fire.'
  arabic: "وَلَكِنَّ مَلاَكَ الرَّبِّ فِي اللَّيْلِ فَتَحَ أَبْوَابَ السِّجْنِ
    وَأَخْرَجَهُمْ وَقَالَ: «اذْهَبُوا قِفُوا وَكَلِّمُوا الشَّعْبَ فِي
    الْهَيْكَلِ بِجَمِيعِ كَلاَمِ هَذِهِ الْحَيَاةِ». فَلَمَّا سَمِعُوا دَخَلُوا
    الْهَيْكَلَ نَحْوَ الصُّبْحِ وَجَعَلُوا يُعَلِّمُونَ. ثُمَّ جَاءَ رَئِيسُ
    الْكَهَنَةِ وَالَّذِينَ مَعَهُ وَدَعَوُا الْمَجْمَعَ وَكُلَّ مَشْيَخَةِ
    بَنِي إِسْرَائِيلَ فَأَرْسَلُوا إِلَى الْحَبْسِ لِيُؤْتَى بِهِمْ. وَلَكِنَّ
    الْخُدَّامَ لَمَّا جَاءُوا لَمْ يَجِدُوهُمْ فِي السِّجْنِ فَرَجَعُوا
    وَأَخْبَرُوا قَائِلِينَ: «إِنَّنَا وَجَدْنَا الْحَبْسَ مُغْلَقاً بِكُلِّ
    حِرْصٍ وَالْحُرَّاسَ وَاقِفِينَ خَارِجاً أَمَامَ الأَبْوَابِ وَلَكِنْ لَمَّا
    فَتَحْنَا لَمْ نَجِدْ فِي الدَّاخِلِ أَحَداً». اِحْمَدُوا الرَّبَّ لأَنَّهُ
    صَالِحٌ لأَنَّ إِلَى الأَبَدِ رَحْمَتَهُ. لِيَقُلْ إِسْرَائِيلُ: [إِنَّ
    إِلَى الأَبَدِ رَحْمَتَهُ]. فِي تِلْكَ السَّاعَةِ تَقَدَّمَ التَّلاَمِيذُ
    إِلَى يَسُوعَ قَائِلِينَ: «فَمَنْ هُوَ أَعْظَمُ فِي مَلَكُوتِ
    السَّمَاوَاتِ؟» فَدَعَا يَسُوعُ إِلَيْهِ وَلَداً وَأَقَامَهُ فِي وَسَطِهِمْ
    وَقَالَ: «اَلْحَقَّ أَقُولُ لَكُمْ: إِنْ لَمْ تَرْجِعُوا وَتَصِيرُوا مِثْلَ
    الأَوْلاَدِ فَلَنْ تَدْخُلُوا مَلَكُوتَ السَّمَاوَاتِ. فَمَنْ وَضَعَ
    نَفْسَهُ مِثْلَ هَذَا الْوَلَدِ فَهُوَ الأَعْظَمُ فِي مَلَكُوتِ
    السَّمَاوَاتِ. وَمَنْ قَبِلَ وَلَداً وَاحِداً مِثْلَ هَذَا بِاسْمِي فَقَدْ
    قَبِلَنِي. وَمَنْ أَعْثَرَ أَحَدَ هَؤُلاَءِ الصِّغَارِ الْمُؤْمِنِينَ بِي
    فَخَيْرٌ لَهُ أَنْ يُعَلَّقَ فِي عُنُقِهِ حَجَرُ الرَّحَى وَيُغْرَقَ فِي
    لُجَّةِ الْبَحْرِ. وَيْلٌ لِلْعَالَمِ مِنَ الْعَثَرَاتِ. فَلاَ بُدَّ أَنْ
    تَأْتِيَ الْعَثَرَاتُ وَلَكِنْ وَيْلٌ لِذَلِكَ الإِنْسَانِ الَّذِي بِهِ
    تَأْتِي الْعَثْرَةُ. فَإِنْ أَعْثَرَتْكَ يَدُكَ أَوْ رِجْلُكَ فَاقْطَعْهَا
    وَأَلْقِهَا عَنْكَ. خَيْرٌ لَكَ أَنْ تَدْخُلَ الْحَيَاةَ أَعْرَجَ أَوْ
    أَقْطَعَ مِنْ أَنْ تُلْقَى فِي النَّارِ الأَبَدِيَّةِ وَلَكَ يَدَانِ أَوْ
    رِجْلاَنِ. وَإِنْ أَعْثَرَتْكَ عَيْنُكَ فَاقْلَعْهَا وَأَلْقِهَا عَنْكَ.
    خَيْرٌ لَكَ أَنْ تَدْخُلَ الْحَيَاةَ أَعْوَرَ مِنْ أَنْ تُلْقَى فِي
    جَهَنَّمَ النَّارِ وَلَكَ عَيْنَانِ."
